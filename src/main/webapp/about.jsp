        Birds are special kind of animal species with certain specific characteristics that are common to all of
        them. All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded,
        vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are
        present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
        Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar
        Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share,
        they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.
        Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big
        as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million
        years ago. Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate,
        four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs
        help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them
        fly to great heights. Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to
        be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across
        generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs
        indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess. Birds are very closely connected with the
        environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region
        much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring
        and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.
